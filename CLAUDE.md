# Network+ AI Quiz — Project Guide

> **This file reloads on every tool call — keep it lean.** Hard cap: **~200 lines / ~25KB** — CI (`tests/uat.js`) fails the build past **250 lines or 30KB**. Deep or task-specific detail lives in `docs/` and `CHANGELOG.md` behind the one-line pointers below; rule of thumb — if it's only needed for *some* tasks, it doesn't belong in this always-loaded file. Version History: inline only the **last 3 ships**, one terse line each.

## Context
- **Single-user app currently** (the user is the student prepping for real N10-009). Explains why items like per-user API cost telemetry are deferred.
- **Future pivot**: paid multi-cert SaaS. Anything tagged `saas-gated` is **frozen** until that trigger fires (see Decision rules).
- **Origin**: Notion-native flashcard quiz (2026-03-28) → standalone web app (2026-04-02). **Notion sync is not on the roadmap — do not re-propose.**
- **External reviewer**: user periodically pastes OpenAI Codex feedback as a product-review signal.

## Architecture
- **Type**: Static HTML/JS/CSS single-page app — no framework, no build step.
- **AI**: three-way Claude split, direct browser fetch (`anthropic-dangerous-direct-browser-access: true`); user supplies their own API key (`STORAGE.KEY`). Haiku 4.5 `CLAUDE_MODEL` = bulk generation (`fetchQuestions`, `tbGenerateAiTopology`); Sonnet 4.6 `CLAUDE_VALIDATOR_MODEL` = semantic second-pass (`aiValidateQuestions`); Sonnet 4.6 `CLAUDE_TEACHER_MODEL` = authoritative teacher content (Tier A/B/C — see key-patterns doc).
- **Storage** (Phase C′): cloud-canonical, localStorage as ephemeral session cache. Source of truth = Supabase (`profiles.metadata` jsonb + `quiz_history`). Write path: localStorage → `_cloudFlush(STORAGE.X)` → 1500ms debounced cloud write. Hydrate: SIGNED_IN → `cloudStore.hydrate()`. Anonymous users get the full app via localStorage only. Cross-subdomain session via cookie-backed Supabase adapter on `Domain=.certanvil.com`.
- **Hosting**: Vercel — `networkplus.certanvil.com` (+ per-cert subdomains, "Pattern A") + `certanvil.com` (separate landing project).
- **Offline/PWA**: service worker (stale-while-revalidate + Supabase API pass-through + auto-reload-on-update). **Cache name MUST bump every deploy — use `bump-version.js`, never hand-edit.** Installable via `manifest.json`.

## Files
| File | Purpose | Size |
|---|---|---|
| `index.html` | All page structures (30+ pages: setup, quiz, exam, results, review, subnet, ports, drills launcher, topology, topology-builder-v3, analytics, progress, guided labs, …) + global chrome (sidebar + topbar incl. `#topbar-bug-report` iconbtn that lazy-loads `features/reports.js`) | ~115 KB |
| `app.js` | All app logic — state, AI calls, rendering, game loops, analytics, 5 activity sub-systems, cloud-flush hooks. Exposes `window.CURRENT_CERT` + `window.CERT_PACK` for lazy-loaded feature modules. | **~964 KB / ~19K lines** |
| `styles.css` | Full dark/light theme styling + account pill + cert switcher + `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)` gate | ~540 KB / ~14.5K lines |
| `dg-system.css` | Editorial design-system overrides — forged-bronze tokens, scoped page reskins, `.br-*` bug-report drawer block (incl. scoped `[hidden]{display:none!important}` since component `display:flex` rules otherwise override the attribute) | growing |
| `sw.js` | Service worker — stale-while-revalidate, shell-asset precache, 60-entry LRU cap, Supabase API pass-through, auto-update broadcast | ~120 lines |
| **`lib/supabase.js`** | **Phase C′** — Supabase client init with cookie-backed storage adapter (cross-subdomain session sharing) | ~150 lines |
| **`lib/supabase-umd.min.js`** | **v4.89.1** — vendored Supabase UMD bundle (was cdn.jsdelivr; vendored after intermittent 503 broke auth) | 197 KB |
| **`cloud-store.js`** | **Phase C′** — debounced cloud flush queue + `hydrate()` + `clearLocalCache()` + `migrateLocalToCloud()` + status-listener API | ~440 lines |
| **`auth-state.js`** | **Phase C′** — account pill + dropdown + auth state machine + sync-status updater + cert switcher | ~390 lines |
| **`migration.js`** | **Phase C′** — one-time builder import banner (reads localStorage stats, bulk-uploads to cloud, sets `migration_v1_at` flag) | ~290 lines |
| **`certs/netplus.js`** + **`certs/secplus.js`** | **v4.86–4.87** — cert pack data (topic catalog, GT tables, exemplars, Phase 3 retention concepts). Loaded before app.js per script-tag order in index.html | netplus ~400 KB, secplus growing |
| **`landing/`** (separate Vercel project) | certanvil.com landing — `index.html` + `auth.js` + `script.js` + `lib/supabase.js` + `sw.js` (kill-switch) + `og-image.svg` + `pricing.html` + `api/notify.js` (Resend) | — |
| **`supabase/migrations/`** | Schema migrations — `20260506_phase_c_prime.sql` adds `profiles.role` + `is_admin()` + RLS updates | — |
| `manifest.json` | PWA manifest | 646 B |
| `vercel.json` | Vercel config (minimal) | 806 B |
| `tests/uat.js` | UAT suite — **~4,005 checks** as of v7.19.4, embeds validation-audit gate | ~19.7K lines |
| `tests/tech-debt.js` | CI thresholds: long-function count, LOC, global count, etc. | 131 lines |
| `tests/validation-audit.js` | 23-Q broken-corpus regression fixture (60% catch floor, 0 FP ceiling) | 589 lines |
| `tests/deploy-verify.js` | Post-deploy smoke against prod (comment-strip fix v4.89.9 / dc844a2) | 335 lines |
| `tests/e2e/app.spec.js` | Playwright E2E (99 tests as of v4.89.x) | — |

**Reality check:** `app.js` size is the driver for [#138](https://github.com/oremosu98/networkplus-quiz/issues/138) (module split) — `saas-gated`, don't start without pivot trigger. `styles.css` growth drove [#55](https://github.com/oremosu98/networkplus-quiz/issues/55) — same gate.

Note: `mockups/` and `dogfood/` deliberately stay at repo root (`/mockups/` is deploy-served per `vercel.json`; `dogfood/` is a documented smoke-test path).

## Decision rules

### `saas-gated` label
Items tagged `saas-gated` on either board are **frozen until the paid-SaaS pivot triggers — do NOT pull one without explicit pivot direction.** Currently gated: [#21](https://github.com/oremosu98/networkplus-quiz/issues/21) (wrap globals into state objects), [#55](https://github.com/oremosu98/networkplus-quiz/issues/55) (split `styles.css`), [#123](https://github.com/oremosu98/networkplus-quiz/issues/123) (social-proof counter), [#135](https://github.com/oremosu98/networkplus-quiz/issues/135) (per-user API cost telemetry), [#136](https://github.com/oremosu98/networkplus-quiz/issues/136) (entitlements + tier quotas), [#137](https://github.com/oremosu98/networkplus-quiz/issues/137) (cost-floor model), [#138](https://github.com/oremosu98/networkplus-quiz/issues/138) (module-split `app.js`, v5.0 trigger), [#139](https://github.com/oremosu98/networkplus-quiz/issues/139) (readiness-algorithm tuning).

### Testing Discipline — NEVER write to user-state localStorage on prod
**Hard rule, no exceptions.** When using the Chrome MCP `javascript_tool` (or anything that runs JS in the user's connected browser), NEVER call `localStorage.setItem/removeItem/clear` on a prod or `*.vercel.app` host — it overwrites the user's real `nplus_*` progress with no undo (this rule was bought with a real v4.81.x data-loss incident). Use one of: a **local server** (`python3 -m http.server 3131` → `localhost`), a **Vercel preview deploy**, or a fresh **incognito window**. Read-only evals on prod are fine. Full incident write-up + the shipped recovery layers live in [docs/conventions/conventions.md](docs/conventions/conventions.md).

## Deployment

### Ship checklist
[`SHIP_CHECKLIST.md`](./SHIP_CHECKLIST.md) codifies the pre-push discipline in 6 phases (automated checks → version+cache → live-verify → schema/RLS → final pre-push gate → post-push smoke). **Walk the Ship checklist before every meaningful push;** skip phases deliberately, not implicitly.

### Multi-engineer feature review
[`.claude/skills/review-feature/SKILL.md`](./.claude/skills/review-feature/SKILL.md) fires 4 parallel agents (Architect/Engineer/Reviewer/Optimizer) for non-trivial proposals (3+ files / new subsystem / schema change / multi-step flow). For trivial ships, just walk the Ship checklist.

### Two paths — prefer push
1. **Canonical**: `git push origin main` → GitHub Actions (UAT + Playwright + `tech-debt.js`) → Vercel auto-deploy → post-deploy smoke. Branch protection requires the "UAT + Playwright" check; admin bypass for emergencies only.
2. **Local quick-ship** (bypasses CI): `export PATH="$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v20.20.2/bin:$PATH"` then `npx vercel --prod --yes`. **Commit immediately before/after** — git↔prod drift once cost 6 versions (v4.39→v4.43.1).

### Version bumps
`node scripts/bump-version.js <new> "<desc>"` updates `APP_VERSION` (app.js) + `CACHE_NAME` (sw.js) + version badge (index.html) + `package.json` + **prepends a 1-line stub row to the Version History table below**. Do NOT hand-edit partial — UAT asserts consistency across all 4 code surfaces. **The stub STAYS a one-line stub here — never expand it inline; full ship detail goes in the commit message + CHANGELOG.md (expanding rows inline is exactly what bloated this file).** The script writes CLAUDE.md, so re-read it before any follow-up edit (any prior snapshot is stale).

## Branching Strategy — Risk-Tiered (adopted 2026-05-12)

> **Full spec: [`ENVIRONMENT_STRATEGY.md`](./ENVIRONMENT_STRATEGY.md)** — read it before any DB/auth/payments/SW change.

**The decision rule: does the change touch the database schema, money, auth, or the service worker? YES → gated lane. NO → fast lane.**

| Lane | Triggers | Flow |
|---|---|---|
| **Fast** (~90%) | exemplars, retention concepts, UI/CSS, copy, non-schema JS, docs, drills | commit → `main` → push → CI → Vercel prod |
| **Gated** (~10%) | `supabase/migrations/*` · `landing/api/{stripe,ai,diagnostic}/*` · `auth-state.js` · `cloud-store.js` · `lib/supabase.js` · `sw.js` · RLS/entitlements/quota | feature branch → PR (auto-spins Supabase branch DB + Vercel preview + CI) → smoke-test preview → squash-merge → prod |

**Gated-lane migration rule**: every `supabase/migrations/*` file dated ≥ 2026-05-12 MUST carry a tested `-- ROLLBACK:` block (pre-cutoff grandfathered → PITR). Gated ships also need migration-applied + env-vars-set + redeploy, and endpoints must graceful-503 on missing env vars.

## Local Development
```bash
cd "/Users/simioremosu/Desktop/Dev Projects/networkplus-quiz"
python3 -m http.server 3131   # → http://localhost:3131
```
Pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`, wired via the `package.json` `prepare` script): runs `node tests/uat.js` + the CLAUDE.md-freshness check + a data-safety scan; skips UAT for docs-only commits. Bypass with `git commit --no-verify`.

**Moving/renaming files:** use `git mv old new` (never raw `mv`) so `git blame`/history follows — confirm the staged diff reads `renamed:`. Full lesson → [docs/conventions/conventions.md](docs/conventions/conventions.md).

## Test Suite
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v20.20.2/bin:$PATH"
node tests/uat.js                # UAT (embeds the validation-audit gate)
node tests/tech-debt.js          # CI thresholds — LOC, globals, long-function count
node tests/validation-audit.js   # broken-corpus fixture, ≥60% catch / 0 FP
npx playwright test              # E2E (tests/e2e/app.spec.js)
```
**Don't tune `validateQuestions()` without running `validation-audit.js` first** — the `MIN_CATCH_RATE = 60` / `MAX_FP_RATE = 0` floor is CI-enforced inside UAT.

## Version History

> **Older releases live in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).** Inline only the **last 3 ships**, **one line each (version + a one-line summary — never multi-paragraph)**. `bump-version.js` prepends a 1-line stub below; it **stays a stub** — full detail goes to the commit message + CHANGELOG.md. Trim back to 3 at the next consolidation.

| Version | Features Added |
|---|---|
| v7.25.0 | SR Phase 6a: lapse-aware partial reset (#3) — wrong drops interval to ~30% of prior, not hard 1 |
| v7.24.0 | SR Phase 5: exam-aware scheduling (#7) — interval cap to exam day, weak/blueprint front-load, countdown |
| v7.23.0 | SR Phase 4: review forecast (#6) — 7-day due-by-day projection on home tile + complete screen |
| v7.22.0 | SR Phase 3 — right-sized sessions (#8): session-size setting + cap 30 + Daily Review settings group |
| v7.21.0 | SR Phase 2 — missed-card recap (#2) + review feeds the daily streak (#4) |
| v7.20.0 | SR Phase 1 — same-session retry (#1) + why-it's-due microcopy (#5) |
| v7.19.5 | Strip tablet-audit (~40MB dev-only) from prod deploy + build.test guard; CLAUDE.md size-figure refresh + version-history trim; /ship skill + git-mv convention |
| v7.19.4 | Mobile fit #2 — My Certs modal scroll, landing iOS input zoom, hamburger drawer full-height on phones (touch-only; desktop unchanged) |
| v7.19.3 | P2-density mobile fit — readiness ribbon, drill-by-domain, mastery stats, Progress topic names fit on phones (touch-only; desktop unchanged) |

## CSS Theme System
Dark theme in `:root`, light theme in `[data-theme="light"]`. Key variables: `--bg`, `--surface`, `--accent`, `--text`, `--green`, `--red`, `--yellow`. Toggle via `toggleTheme()`.

## Common Gotchas

**Code shape**
- The `pick()` function targets `#options .option` — CLI sim diagnosis MCQ must be inside `#options` div
- Topology scoring uses `correctPlacements` object mapping device→zone name (exact string match)
- Exam answers init must include `cliRan: [], topoState: {}` for PBQ types
- `hasAnswer` checks must include `Object.keys(a.topoState || {}).length > 0`
- `setQuestionText(el, raw)` order is **escape-THEN-highlight** (`escHtml` → `highlightExamKeywords` → `innerHTML`). Reversing it is an XSS hole since question text is AI-generated.
- The `_fnBody(src, name)` helper used by UAT extracts function bodies via brace-depth walking. **Prefix-match trap**: `tbShowCoach` will match `tbShowCoachModalLoading`. When writing UAT for a function, pick a name that's either unique or specify the exact suffix.

**Testing**
- Don't tune `validateQuestions()` without running `node tests/validation-audit.js` first — the `MIN_CATCH_RATE = 60` / `MAX_FP_RATE = 0` floor is CI-enforced inside UAT
- Don't pull `saas-gated` items (see Conventions list) without explicit pivot direction
- `tests/uat.js` prefers behavioral smoke over structural; see Testing Philosophy

**Deploy**
- Service worker cache name must be bumped on every deploy or users get stale files — use `scripts/bump-version.js`, never hand-edit partial
- Vercel CLI requires nvm path export: `export PATH="$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v20.20.2/bin:$PATH"`
- If you're tempted to `vercel --prod` without committing, **commit and push immediately after** — git↔prod drift cost us 6 versions (v4.39→v4.43.1) before it got caught
- Branch protection on `main` requires the "UAT + Playwright" status check; admin bypass works but defeats the point — only use for real emergencies

**Infra**
- `PROJECT_TOKEN` repo secret is a PAT with `project` scope (not the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`). Powers both `auto-add-to-board.yml` and `auto-archive-done.yml`. If rotated, update in GitHub repo secrets or both workflows fail loud.
- `deploy-verification.yml` runs post-deploy against the public URL — legit failures mean prod is broken; stale-cache failures mean give CDN a minute and re-run.
- When UAT fails mid-session, check `tests/validation-audit.js` first — a change to `validateQuestions()`, the GT tables, or the prompt can trip the regression gate without any UAT-level error being obvious.

---

## Post-deploy verification (always run after ship)

Headless UAT + Playwright can pass while real users see broken UI — it happened repeatedly across the v6.5.x run. After any feature/fix lands on `main` and Deploy Verification reports success, **drive the live prod URL in a real browser before claiming done**:

1. **Cache-bust navigate** to the prod URL with a `?_cb=<version>` query (bypass the SW cache) using the Chrome MCP tools.
2. **Reproduce the user's exact click path** — don't shortcut via JS calls; click through mode pills / pickers as a user would.
3. **Measure DOM rects + computed styles**, not just internal state (canvas/panel sizes, theme-token colors, new-panel `position`/`transform`/`display`, viewport visibility).
4. **Walk the full flow** end-to-end (first interaction → advance → completion → exit → reload).
5. **Only then claim "shipped + verified".** Ship a hotfix before signing off if anything's off.

**Skip only when** the change is purely backend/data/docs with no user-facing surface, or behind a flag that's off in prod. Reason this rule exists: UAT regex-tests source strings and Playwright runs fresh navigations — both miss live-interaction layout bugs, theme-mismatched colors, viewport carry-over, and CSS-grid collisions.
