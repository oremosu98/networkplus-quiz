## Feature Sub-Architectures

### Topology Builder (~4,500 LOC in app.js)
Canvas: `TB_CANVAS_W = 1800`, `TB_CANVAS_H = 1100` (v4.39.0 bump for AI-generated topologies). Key pieces:
- `TB_LAB_CATEGORIES` at `app.js:13570` — groups the lab catalog by concept (Fundamentals / Switching / Routing / Services / Security / Cloud & WAN / Wireless & QoS / Troubleshooting). **29 concept labs + 35 auto-generated config variants** (honest count; previously inflated to "65 labs").
- `tbActiveLab` state drives Coach context: when a lab is active, `tbCoachTopology()` prompts Claude as tutor with step N of M + step goal + hint. Cache key differentiated by lab+step.
- `tbDeepValidateAndFix(state, scenario)` — AI-output guard, runs after every AI generation to catch malformed JSON, missing fields, bunched positioning.
- `tbAutoLayout(state)` — force-directed post-pass. Detects clustered seeds (spread <250px), grid-seeds, runs 260 iterations (`REPULSE = 9000/dist²`, `SPRING = 0.06`, `IDEAL_LINK = 200`, velocity damping 0.85, cap 30), final hard-separation pass to `MIN_SEP = 150`.
- `tbProcessCliCommand(dev, cmd)` — 8-line dispatcher over the declarative `_TB_CLI_COMMANDS` table (~37 entries). Each CLI command maps to an isolated `_cli<Name>(dev, cmd)` handler. Match spec: `string | string[] | (cmd)=>bool`. Refactored from a 452-line if/else chain in v4.62.4 / #126 — see *Regression-Guard Tombstones*.
- L2/L3 simulation engine, packet-flow animation, "Fix This Network" challenges, PNG export, AI Generate v2, AI Coach.
- **Scenarios (v4.47.0)**: `TB_SCENARIOS` array at `app.js:7358` holds **16 scenarios** (Free Build + 8 legacy + 7 new). Each has `{id, title, description, requirements, ruleIds, requires, explanation}`. The `explanation` field powers a collapsible "Learn more about this network" `<details>` panel below the requirements list — 5 sub-sections (Overview / How it routes data / Key devices / Key concepts / Exam relevance) keyed to N10-009 objectives. Grouped in the dropdown via `<optgroup>` (Campus & Enterprise / WAN Architectures / Cloud Networking). Light grading convention: new scenarios reuse `min-devices` + `no-orphans` + device-count requirements rather than authoring brand-new rule functions — educational value comes from the shape + explanation. `tbRenderScenarioPanel` at `app.js:7527` builds the UI conditionally on `scen.explanation` so a scenario without the field still renders cleanly (backward-compatible).
- **Consumer endpoint devices (v4.47.0)**: `laptop`, `smartphone`, `game-console`, `smart-tv` added to `TB_DEVICE_TYPES` + `TB_PALETTE_GROUPS.Endpoints` + `TB_IFACE_DEFAULTS`. All are single-interface client devices (smartphone uses `wlan0`, others `eth0`). The `isEndpoint` family check (3 sites: health check at `app.js:6661`, overlay at `app.js:8127`, gateway-UI at `app.js:8199`) was expanded to include all 4 — so they accept `gateway` config + render correct health color + show the gateway field in the overlay.

### Subnet Trainer
- 21 granular question types (CIDR, VLSM, usable hosts, broadcast, gateway placement, NAT boundary, …). Adaptive difficulty, step-by-step feedback.
- `stRenderDashboard()` shows 3 prescriptive callouts: **Weakest Categories** (<75% acc, ≥5 attempts), **Stale Categories** (>7 days), **Weakest Question Types** (<70% acc, ≥3 attempts). Each click-through jumps to `stDashJumpToCategory(catId)` = Practice tab + Focus mode + category pre-selected.
- `stAskCoach()` — Tier B. Computes deterministic binary breakdown (IP / mask / IP AND mask) and stuffs into prompt as AUTHORITATIVE FACTS before asking Sonnet. AI can't hallucinate the math.
- `WEAK_SPOT_DRILL_BRIDGES` at `app.js:3780` — main-app weak topics that route into Subnet Trainer (`Subnetting & IP Addressing`, `IPv6`, `NAT & IP Services`). Deduped. **Topology Builder deliberately excluded** — it's a standalone activity, not a reactive drill target.

### Drills Launcher
`#page-drills` wraps 4 drills consolidated from what was a 4-tile nav row (v4.41.0):
1. **Port Drill** — `startPortDrill()` — 4 modes (Timed / Endless / Family / Secure Pairs)
2. **Acronym Blitz** — `startAcronymBlitz()` — 130+ N10-009 acronyms
3. **OSI Sorter** — `startOsiSorter()` — drag/click protocols onto correct OSI layer
4. **Cable & Connector ID** — `startCableId()` — cable image → name

Shared `createDrillScaffold(cfg)` at `app.js:17766` syncs `.active` / `aria-selected` / `aria-pressed` states across tabs + modes. All 3 newer drills (AB/OS/CB) have full ARIA coverage matching quiz/exam pages post-v4.42.5. Each drill has its own `*_MASTERY` + `*_LESSONS` localStorage keys.
